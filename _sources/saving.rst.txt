Saving & Exporting
******************

Saving and Loading Sessions
===========================
At any stage, you can save your session by going to File->Save.
You will then be prompted to set a name for the session.
You can also choose if you wish to compress the session files.
If you do, this will take longer to save, but will take up less storage space.
Upon closing the session, you will be automatically prompted to save it.
Next time you open up the app, if you have any sessions saved, 
you will automatically be provided with a dropdown list where you can select a session to load.
Alternatively you can load a new session.

Note that sessions are saved in a folder called **DVC_Sessions** which will have been created
in the location that you opened up the app from.
Therefore it is important that you always open up the app from the same location,
to ensure all of your sessions are found. Going into this folder and opening or editing the
files can cause problems with reloading the sessions, so instead of doing this,
if you would like to access the session files you should export the session.

.. _Exporting Sessions:
Exporting Sessions
==================
At any point, you can export the session files by going to File->Export.
This allows you to choose any location in your directories to save a copy of the session files.
This is the best way to store your results if you would like to open the files.
