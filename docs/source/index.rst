Welcome to iDVC's documentation!
================================
The iDVC app allows a digital volume correlation analysis to be performed on a reference and correlate image volume. You may either use a point cloud you have pre-created, or generate this in the app.
This manual was written at the time of version 24.1.0 being the latest release.
