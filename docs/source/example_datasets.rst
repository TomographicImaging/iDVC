Example datasets
****************
The dataset "Dynamic X-ray CT of Synthetic magma for Digital Volume Correlation analysis" [1] has been acquired at the Diamond Light Source synchrotron, with a bespoke thermo-mechanical rig (“P2R”) on the I12 beamline.
“dataset_0.npy” has no applied compression, while and “dataset_1.npy” has applied compression (total 4.8 GB).

Inport the files in the iDVC app to run the digital volume correlation analysis.
