Calculate the strain
**************
Whether you have installed the full gui, or just the executable, you are able to calculate the strain from the command line, in the environment where you have installed it.
Please note that the latest release does not allow the calculation of the strain in the GUI, this needs to be implemented in the command line.

The DVC results are saved in the folder "Results", which is generated by running the DVC code, either in the GUI or in the executable. Navigate in the results folder from the command line. 
Note that this is generated in the GUI only after a session is saved. 

``cd Results`` 

From this folder, in the terminal, type

``strain  dvc_result_0.disp``

This command creates 2 files with strain results calculated from the displacement file.
